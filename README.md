# FaceAttend — Attendance System

Face-recognition attendance system using OpenCV + DeepFace (ArcFace), Flask backend, and a live web dashboard.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the server
python app.py
```

Open `static/index.html` in your browser (or serve it via Flask).

## How to Enroll a Face

1. Make sure the person is **in frame** and facing the camera.
2. Type their name in the **Enroll Face** box in the UI.
3. Click **Capture** — it saves the current frame to `face_db/<name>/`.
4. Capture **3–5 photos** per person from slightly different angles for better accuracy.

## Sparsh CCTV Over Ethernet (Windows PowerShell)

Set your camera details (replace values with your actual ones):

```powershell
$env:SPARSH_CCTV_IP = "192.168.128.10"
$env:SPARSH_CCTV_USER = "admin"
$env:SPARSH_CCTV_PASSWORD = "admin123"
$env:SPARSH_CCTV_PORT = "554"
$env:SPARSH_CCTV_PATH = "h264/ch1/main/av_stream"
python app.py
```
```export SPARSH_CCTV_IP=192.168.128.10
export SPARSH_CCTV_USER=admin
export SPARSH_CCTV_PASSWORD=admin123
export SPARSH_CCTV_PORT=554
export SPARSH_CCTV_PATH=h264/ch1/main/av_stream
python app.py```


Optional: if your Sparsh stream uses a different RTSP path, only change `SPARSH_CCTV_PATH`.

You can also provide a full source directly:

```powershell
$env:CAMERA_SOURCE = "rtsp://admin:admin123@192.168.128.10:554/stream1"
python app.py
```

| `GET /api/attendance/all` | All records                        |
| `GET /api/enrolled`       | List of enrolled people            |
| `GET /api/detections`     | Current frame detections (live)    |
| `GET /api/status`         | Camera + DB status                 |

## Tips

- Run recognition on every **5th frame** (`FRAME_SKIP = 5`) — adjustable in `app.py`
- Attendance is logged **once per person per day** (deduped by SQLite UNIQUE constraint)
- Delete `face_db/representations_arcface.pkl` if recognition seems stale after re-enrollment
- For better accuracy: enroll in the **same lighting conditions** as deployment
